Candy Sales Analysis Project
This project analyzes candy sales data over multiple years to identify seasonal trends and determine which season generates the highest sales. Using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries, we explore monthly and seasonal patterns in candy sales.

Project Overview
This analysis covers candy sales from 2021 to 2024. By grouping sales data by month and season, we aim to uncover which time of year is most lucrative for candy sales.
