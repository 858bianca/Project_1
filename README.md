Candy Sales Analysis Project

This project analyzes candy sales data over multiple years to identify seasonal, product and regional trends.  We seek to identify which season generates the highest sales. Which specific product and product division generates the highest profits; and determine whether these findings are consistent across states and regions.  To complete the analysis we will use Python's data analysis and visualization libraries.

Project Overview
The data ranges from 2021 to 2024. By grouping sales data by month and season, we aim to uncover which time of year is most lucrative for candy sales.
